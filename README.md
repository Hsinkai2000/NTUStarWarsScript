# NTU Star Wars Module Registration Script

This Python script automates the process of registering for modules at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) during the biyearly star wars.

## Introduction

Every semester, NTU students engage in a competitive process known as "star wars" to secure modules for their upcoming semester. During this period, students often find themselves competing against each other to enroll in popular and high-demand modules.

This repository contains a Python script built with Selenium that helps students automate the process of registering for modules during the star wars period. By leveraging automation, the script aims to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of module registration, giving students a competitive edge.

## Features

- **Automated Module Registration**: The script automates the entire module registration process, from logging in to the student portal to selecting and enrolling in desired modules.

- **Customizable Preferences**: Users can customize their preferences within the script, such as the list of desired modules and timing for registration attempts.

- **Error Handling**: The script includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected events during the registration process, ensuring a smooth execution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Chrome or Firefox web browser

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install selenium`.
